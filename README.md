# Celebrity-search-engine-langchain-

Worked on the prompt template from the chains using the langchain and integrated the prompts input and output using the Sequential chain from the langchain.The output is in the format of JSON or key value due to the input_text(format).

All the working code is present on the example1.py and the constants.py should contain your openapi key to run this and need to run any LLM.The main.py runs the usual app and the interface is built using the streamlit and UI too. Additionally Flask can be used too.

To run ensure the python version to be more than atleast 3.9 or so or try to create a python environment and install the necessary packages in the requirements.txt.
